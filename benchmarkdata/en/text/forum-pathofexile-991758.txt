Great vid. Since your fully showing your gear and build you should consider posting the guide on poearena.com. it needs more caster builds!

I don't think your cast on crit helm works the way you think it works though...!

Basically your helm gets a 5th link that has the CoC gem in it:

But you still need an Attack gem in your helm and you need to crit with that Attack in order to proc any of the spells you have in your helm.

ahhh. alright i get it thx

tho the gem doesnt specifically say that you need to crit with something linked, i thought it was just crit in general
